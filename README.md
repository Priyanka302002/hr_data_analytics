## 📊 **Charts & Visualizations**

This project includes the following visualizations to provide actionable insights from the HR data:

### 1. **Pie Chart: Attrition by Education 🎓**
Shows the distribution of employee attrition across various educational levels. This helps in understanding whether education level correlates with employee retention.

### 2. **Bar Chart: Attrition by Age 📅**
A bar chart depicting employee attrition across different age groups. This helps in analyzing which age group has the highest attrition.

### 3. **Table: Job Roles 💼**
Displays the number of employees by their job roles and their respective attrition rates. It highlights if certain roles have higher turnover rates.

### 4. **Cluster Bar Chart: Attrition by Salary Slab 💰**
A cluster bar chart that segments employee attrition by different salary slabs, helping HR to identify if salary influences attrition.

### 5. **Line Graph: Attrition by Years at Company 📆**
This line graph shows how employee attrition varies depending on how long employees have been with the company.

### 6. **Cluster Bar Chart: Attrition by Job Role 🧑‍💻**
Another cluster bar chart showing attrition rates across various job roles, helping HR understand which roles are more prone to high turnover.

### 7. **Tree Map: Attrition by Gender 👨‍🦱👩‍🦳**
A tree map visualizing attrition by gender, helping HR understand if there is any gender-based disparity in employee attrition.

### 8. **Slicer: HR, Research & Development, and Sales 🏢**
A slicer that allows HR to filter the data by different departments like **Human Resources**, **Research & Development**, and **Sales** to analyze attrition specific to these departments.
